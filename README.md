# This was made after the hackathon submit
We had an issue when we first uploaded this proyect, some Github commit issues.
That happend 1 hour before the end of the event.
We're sorry if this is out of rules; we just wanted you to show how hard we worked for this proyect.
If you want to check the progress made before the commit, you can check with the log of the proyect; it's not functional.
